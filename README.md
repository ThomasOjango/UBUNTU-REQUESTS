# 🌍 Ubuntu Requests: Image Fetcher

> **"I am because we are." — Ubuntu Philosophy**

This project is inspired by the wisdom of **Ubuntu**, which emphasizes **community, sharing, and respect**.  
The script connects to the global community of the internet, fetches shared resources (images), and organizes them for later appreciation.

## ✨ Features
- 📥 Prompt the user for an image URL  
- 🗂️ Creates a directory called `Fetched_Images` (if it doesn’t exist)  
- 🌐 Downloads and saves the image with an appropriate filename  
- ⚠️ Handles errors gracefully (invalid URL, connection issues, missing filename, etc.)  
- 💡 Built with respect for Ubuntu principles: **community, sharing, respect, and practicality**

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ubuntu_fetcher.py
